/**
 * ==================
 * Frequency Counter
 * ==================
 * Use an Object or set to collect values/frequencies of values
 * Useful for avoiding nested loops, use multiple single loops
 *
 * Example: To compare 2 arrays without nested loops, create 2 objects from those arrays with the frequency of items and comepare in induvidual loops
 *
 * ==================
 * Multiple Pointers
 * ==================
 * Create 2 or more pointers or values that corresponds to and index or position, move in direction based on condition
 *
 * Example: Get 2 nums in sorted array that add to equal zero, create 2 pointers at beginning and end that converge to find solution
 *
 * ==================
 * Sliding Window
 * ==================
 * Use "Window" to slide through collection to get solution
 *
 * Example: Find 2 nums in array that when added produce the largest value of the rest
 *
 * ==================
 * Divide and Conquer
 * ==================
 * Divide data set into smaller chunks and then repeat process to find solution
